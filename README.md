# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

**DataSet**
The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Using the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page I chose to visualize significant earthquakes in the past 30 days.

**Output**
Visualized an earthquake dataset showing significant earthquakes in the past 30 days globally. Created maps using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from data set based on their longitude and latitude.

  Map features:
   * data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

   * Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Legend that will provide context for your map data.

   * Multiple layers and layer control that can switch layer views
